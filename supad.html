			<p>Pushing two decades of active involvement in London’s underground music culture, Supa D is a UK house legend.
				</p>
								<p>To say someone like Supa
				D is a key figure in one ‘scene’ would be an understatement: along with his
				longtime DJ partner Pioneer, his fellow Circle crew members Kismet, Feva and IC,
				and contemporaries like Sef Kombo, Petchy, Wigman and others, it would be
				better to describe him as a key figure in an <i>underground house music ecosystem</i>.
				This is a London ecosystem of DJs, producers, promoters, radio stations, venues and networks that
				has been built outside of and in parallel to the predominantly white and
				middle-class “House and Techno” establishment, with its closer ties to major
				labels (and their subsidiaries), PR and communications agencies, and transnational
				music media.</p>
				
				<p>Frozen out of this establishment
				and its institutions due to racism and classism, the recent histories of the subgenres
				and scenes that Supa D has been part of – soulful house, funky house, Afro
				house, deep and tech house – were effectively erased by the music journalism of
				the late 2000s and early 2010s (see <a href="https://itsrosh.nfshost.com/letter/" target="blank">'A Letter to RA'</a>). When the story of UK funky made it through, Supa D and his peers were
				usually left out of the picture, and the subgenre appeared as a flash
				in the pan rather than being fully contextualised within the developments of
				this house ecosystem.</p>
				
				<p>After many years building a loyal
				crowd of ravers through his event brand houSupa, Supa D now plays in London at
				busy clubnights nearly every weekend. Following the success of his Afro house-centred
				party Afrotized, Supa D expanded houSupa into a label of the same name in 2019,
				founded to push the Afro, soulful house and amapiano-influenced tracks being played by
				himself and close associates. With group photos circulating of the crew proudly
				wearing houSupa t-shirts at its launch, the label is formed from a community,
				and has become a respected, regular home for producer-DJs who had previously
				released music sporadically on disparate labels.</p>
				
				<p>With all this behind him, Supa D
				remains humble, focusing on what he wants to do next, how he could be doing more,
				and on making the right moves to maintain the community that supports his ventures
				in music. Now that amapiano has injected a fresh set of sounds and a certain
				amount of hype into the Afro house movement, he remains concentrated on his
				label showcase events, quality control, respect for South Africa’s originators,
				and on elevating his collective.</p>

				&nbsp

				<p><b>NKC: </b>How did you get started out in music, did you go
				through many other genres before you settled into the house scene?</p>
				
				<p><b>Supa D: </b>I first started in
				the jungle days. I was collecting jungle vinyl. Then I went through the
				transition from jungle to garage. I touched on the early days of grime. I was on
				Deja Vu at the time with the Bachelor Crew. Mondays was when all the crews
				played – NASTY Crew, Roll Deep, Ruff Sqwad.</p>
				
				<p>That was about 2003/2004. It all
				got a bit too much and they stopped doing the crew shows on the station, but I
				was still there doing shows by myself. I worked at a record shop and I was
				always collecting house tunes, but I didn’t get a chance to play them. One
				Christmas Day I did a whole show of house and then just continued since.</p>
				
				&nbsp

				<p><b>NKC</b>: What kind of house
				music were you playing back then?</p>
				
				<p><b>Supa D:</b> It was soulful
				house, funky, the early Defected stuff and ’83 West. It was a lot of imports
				them times, from America. Even today I still play some of those tracks. I was
				playing all that on vinyl up until about 2007.</p>
				
				&nbsp

				<p><b>NKC</b>: Do you have a musical
				family?</p>
				
				<p><b>Supa D: </b>My dad owned sound
				systems, so I was born into it. He plays everything. It’s in my genes!</p>
				
				&nbsp

				<p><b>NKC</b>: The way I see the
				house music scene in London is that it’s gone from soulful house, to funky
				house, to deep and tech house in the 2010s, and now it’s evolved to Afro house
				and amapiano. Would you agree with that?</p>
				
				<p><b>Supa D:</b> It’s gone round in
				a circle, basically. It was always there, but now everyone’s jumped back on it,
				that’s ultimately rebirthed it again. Loads of us didn’t give up on it, basically.
				Sometimes it’s about doing what you believe in, and once there’s good quality
				music out there, you can’t go wrong.</p>
				
				&nbsp

				<p><b>NKC: </b>You DJed in the deep
				and tech house scene as well, but would you say that soulful and Afro house is
				closer to what you believe in?</p>
				
				<p><b>Supa D: </b>Yeah, the Afro,
				soulful, amapiano – that’s my vibe. The deep tech stuff, I liked some of it. If
				it’s got a nice groove to it, I can work with it, but on a whole it’s soulful, Afro,
				and amapiano for me.</p>
				
				&nbsp

				<p><b>NKC: </b>Would you say the
				Afro sound is as popular or more popular than the deep tech sound in London?</p>
				
				<p><b>Supa D: </b>It’s hard to
				explain, it’s two different scenes. Deep tech is still there and it’s still
				big, and there are big events. That’s never going to go away. The Afro house
				and amapiano side of things has big events too. Then a lot of people cross over
				as well. </p>
				
				<p>They’re both big in their own
				way. Deep tech has always been there and it’ll always probably be bigger
				because it’s more universal. Afro house has still got a way to go, but it’s up
				there still, and I want it to get bigger.</p>
				
				&nbsp

				<p><b>NKC: </b>There’s a lot of
				crossover with some event lineups, there are people from both genres on there.</p>
				
				<p><b>Supa D</b>: You’ll have one
				room with all of us lot in there and then you get the next room with all the
				deep tech DJs. It goes hand in hand, all under the same house umbrella.</p>
				
				&nbsp

				<p><b>NKC: </b>What made you decide
				to start up Afrotized in 2018?</p>
				
				<p><b>Supa D: </b>Afrotized is
				somewhere where you can not play the main top ten club tracks in our scene.
				It’s for the music that you don’t normally hear. People come play new tunes,
				underground tunes, not the same regular tunes that people always want to hear.
				That was the main idea of it.</p>

				<p>It was more Afro house to start
				with, the amapiano came in at the beginning of 2019. There was a lot of people
				playing it, or playing certain tracks, but no one would know what it was. They
				didn’t know it was amapiano, they would put it all under the same Afro house
				banner. We were playing them together, even if we were speeding it up. We were
				making it fit into what we play and how we play.</p>
				
				<p>That’s where we might be
				different and do things different compared to the SA DJs, where everything is
				set at one tempo. We would jumble and mix it up, and make it work in our world
				and our vibe.</p>
				
				<img class="home-image" alt="Supa D" src="images/supad2.jpg">

				&nbsp

				<p><b>NKC: </b>You’ve mentioned
				before that what appeals to you and your crowd with amapiano is the
				basslines. Why are the basslines so important?</p>
				
				<p><b>Supa D: </b>When I was growing
				up, coming from the soundsystem thing – heavy basslines and a good soundsystem,
				it always creates that vibe. A lot of ama tracks are bass-driven. When it hits
				you, especially with a good system, you ain’t got no choice not to move and
				hold a vibe. </p>
				
				<p>Everyone loves that vibe. When
				the music hits you and you’ve got a proper system, you can’t really go round
				it.</p>
				
				&nbsp

				<p><b>NKC: </b>Why did you
				launch houSupa as a label?</p>
				
				<p><b>Supa D: </b>It was part of my
				own personal goals, to have a record label, to have events. It’s a whole
				umbrella. I wanted to get something out there and have a platform for up and
				coming DJs and producers, to try to keep the scene alive, and to let people
				know what we’re doing over here.</p>
				
				&nbsp

				<p><b>NKC:</b> It’s been one of my
				favourite labels over the last few years, and you kept pushing a lot of new
				dance music out there even during the pandemic.</p>
				
				<p><b>Supa D: </b>We’ve got a good
				collection of producers on the label. There’s a lot of stuff to come. There’s
				going to be more vocal stuff coming out in 2023, and people are teaming up. I’m
				always open to new producers. If I hear something and someone reaches out, I’m
				always open to them jumping onboard.</p>
				
				&nbsp

				<p><b>NKC: </b><a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_fLVpzXv8o" target="blank">'King and Queen’</a> was
				a massive anthem on houSupa and then got picked up and re-released by a major label – Sony – did
				that change anything for houSupa?</p>
				
				<p><b>Supa D: </b>It’s a tricky one.
				With that, it was a learning thing to see how certain things are.</p>
				
				<p>It’s good – it’s knowing that
				it’s not about the money sometimes. I felt like it could have been pushed more
				on their side – you’re expecting that to happen. </p>
			
				<p>It didn’t make us disheartened,
				it just made us think, ‘okay, what difference are they making, really?’ We’ll
				just carry on pushing, doing what we’re doing. It’s about recognition – getting
				people from over there to come and see what we’re doing over here. That was the
				main thing.</p>

				&nbsp
				
				<p><b>NKC: </b>So through that you
				found out that you have enough power to do it all yourselves?</p>
				
				<p><b>Supa D</b>: I felt like we had
				the power to get their attention, that’s how we did it in the first place. You
				have a vision in your head of working with a major label… You’re thinking,
				‘rah, why aren’t they doing this and doing that?’ Anything that’s been done was
				off our own back. Certain people playing it on radio, it was all people that I
				know, that were playing it before it got picked up by Sony.</p>
				
				<p>I wanted them to take it to the
				next level. The underground thing, we’ve already got that, so it was about the
				other world. But again, it’s a learning thing. You never know, it might happen
				again and then we might look at it differently and take a different approach.</p>
				
				&nbsp

				<p><b>NKC: </b>How would you
				describe the houSupa sound?</p>
				
				<p><b>Supa D: </b>If I hear
				something and I feel like it’s a vibe, and I know it can work, then I’m all for
				it. Whether it’s amapiano, Afro house, soulful house – I’m all for it.</p>
				
				<p>There are things that I’ve turned
				down, loads of people have asked me, but it has to be something that I know
				could work.</p>
				
				<p>How I look at it is things that I
				would play myself go on the label. So I’m trusting my judgment. You don’t
				always get it right, certain tunes are bigger than you expect. Everyone’s got
				their own taste, but I stand by my experience and my ear.</p>
				
				<p>It’s amapiano, Afro, but with the
				UK style of it – it’s still got that UK-ness. You can tell the tracks are from
				the UK. From the beginning, people were just learning the amapiano sounds. Now
				people are more advanced into it, people sound more like SA producers. But
				everyone had to go through that transition. They're getting the influence from
				there, but making it their own.</p>
				
				&nbsp

				<p><b>NKC: </b>I feel like when
				people are still learning, that’s the interesting bit.</p>
				
				<p><b>Supa D: </b>Even ‘King and
				Queen’ – it’s amapiano-influenced, but listening back to it now, most people
				would say ‘this ain’t amapiano.’ But we were at the early stages of learning
				and producing it. People have learned more and advanced more along the way.
				Everyone’s got knowledge and they are talented, so it can only get better.</p>
				
				&nbsp

				<p><b>NKC:</b> Do you see the Afro
				house scene and amapiano scene as being separate, or do you think there’s so
				much overlap that it’s like one big scene?</p>
				
				<p><b>Supa D: </b>You’ve got the Afro
				house and Afro tech scene, then you’ve got the fully amapiano side, where it’s
				all raw, and it’s all South African music, then you’ve got our thing, where
				it’s a cross between all of them, it’ll be a mix. It’s like three different scenes.</p>
				
				<p>Our thing is a blend of amapiano,
				Afro, soulful. We’ve always done that. We’re bringing in the old soulful
				classics with a brand new amapiano tune, keeping it all fresh and vibey. You’re
				giving them something new but you’re giving them the classics as well. That’s
				how our scene’s always been. </p>
				
				<p>It’s always been a mixture, since
				the early Afro days. But obviously, everything was just called funky back then!
				It’s hard to bloody explain to everyone.</p>

				<img class="home-image" alt="Supa D" src="images/housupa.jpg">
				
				&nbsp

				<p><b>NKC: </b>So back in the funky
				house days, people didn’t realise they were hearing South African house, or
				tribal house from New York, and they just said that it was funky?</p>
				
				<p><b>Supa D: </b>All the time,
				everything – broken beats, tribal house, it was all ‘funky’ at the time. It was
				the same thing early days when I was playing amapiano at Afrotized. No one
				didn’t know, everyone just assumed it was Afro house or funky. They didn’t know
				it was amapiano. But that’s what we’re here for as well init, to introduce and
				let people know about new music.</p>
				
				&nbsp

				<p><b>NKC: </b>There are a lot of
				new raves popping up in London in this scene. It seems mostly in the soulful,
				amapiano crossover scene, your area with houSupa. Why do you think there are so
				many new raves?</p>
				
				<p><b>Supa D: </b>It’s like
				everything, when people see something popping, everyone wants to jump back on
				it. It was the same thing with funky. When everyone got to run off and do this
				and do that, no one didn’t want to try to keep the scene alive. It’s like we
				have to do that – then everyone sees that we’ve built it up again, and then
				they’re like ‘let’s do this now.’</p>
				
				<p>It’s always going to happen, so
				that’s why you have to stay ahead of it, at the forefront. The scene can get
				oversaturated, but then people will learn init. You have to be in it to win it,
				so if people want to take that chance and jump in, then go ahead. You might be
				successful, you might not be.</p>
				
				<p>There are new events that have
				come up that are doing well now – like Dankie Sounds and things like that.
				Their thing is big at the moment, they’ve got the uni crowd and all that. If
				they do things right then they’ll have that crowd there for the next ten years.</p>
				
				&nbsp

				<p><b>NKC: </b>You’ve got a really
				dedicated, loyal crowd in London for the houSupa raves. If a load of new,
				random people turned up because the sound had got more popular, would that be a
				bad thing?</p>
				
				<p><b>Supa D: </b>That’s always
				good, the more the better. I’ve been doing this for so long, we’ve got a whole
				new demographic of people, and a bigger age range as well. You’ve got people
				who are 30-40+ coming out, then you’ve got people in their early 20s coming as
				well. It’s about holding on to all of that. More so the younger ones, because
				they’re the ones who are going to be continuing raving for the next ten years.
				All the 40+, they’re going to sit down in a minute.</p>
				
				&nbsp

				<p><b>NKC: </b>Would you say the
				demographic has changed then, you’ve noticed that with the crowds?</p>
				
				<p><b>Supa D: </b>Yeah, definitely. I’ve
				seen at certain events – you’ve got younger ones, older ones. A lot of the
				younger ones have just been waiting until they could come out. They hear about
				it from their older sisters, brothers, mums, dads, whoever it is that used to
				go to the raves. Now they can go out. My daughter comes now, she’s 21!</p>
				
				&nbsp

				<p><b>NKC: </b>You’ve talked in the
				past about how the quality control of UK funky wasn’t always there. Is there
				anything you’re doing differently this time around? Do you select music only
				from the houSupa camp and South Africa now?</p>
				
				<p><b>Supa D:</b> You see what it is
				– now, there has to be quality control. There has to be, we can’t let it get
				into the funky days. Everyone’s more or less on that same wavelength now.
				Everyone’s advanced since then. But me, if I don’t like it, I ain’t playing it
				anyway.</p>
				
				<p>If it’s gimmicky, then it can go
				left. You can do the gimmick stuff, if it’s coming from the SA people, that’s
				their stuff anyway, so it’s alright. But us doing it, anything that we come
				with has to be proper, basically. Because we’ve got more to prove. Over there
				they’ve got so much talent, it’s like effortless. </p>
				
				<p>Here, we’re trying to feed off
				their vibe and create our own. You have to respect it. Make it your own but
				still respect it. Even down to vocal tunes, whatever it is – everything has to
				be on point, has to be at a certain level.</p>
				
				<img class="home-image" alt="Supa D" src="images/supad3.jpg">

				&nbsp

				<p><b>NKC: </b>You play in London nearly every weekend – do you ever get
				offers to play in other European cities?</p>
				
				<p><b>Supa D:</b> Recently I’ve been
				playing in Dubai, I’ve been a few times this year. I’ve got a lot of things in
				the pipeline for next year, like Amsterdam, Malta, Portugal. There’s a lot of
				talks and things meant to be happening, but it’s about getting certain things
				over the line. It’s about spreading the sound and letting people know what
				we’re doing over here, and then try and make it branch out, that’s one of the
				goals.</p>

				&nbsp
				
				<p><b>NKC: </b>Some of the people from
				the UK funky days – like Roska and Scratcha for example – would play shows in
				Europe and America, as part of tours and sometimes with smaller promoters. Did
				you get offers like that or do you think people weren’t aware of what you were
				doing in funky and Afro house back then? Did you ever turn anything down to focus on playing
				to your London crowd?</p>
				
				<p><b>Supa D: </b>I don’t think
				people were aware. Sometimes it’s about who’s behind you as well. It’s about
				good management skills and reaching out to different worlds. Sometimes I’m my
				own worst enemy in terms of not networking properly. To me, I want everything
				to be organic, but sometimes it don’t work that way.</p>
				
				<p>I’ve played up and down the UK,
				but not really in Europe. I’ve played in Amsterdam, but a lot of the time, it’s
				people doing stuff from here when I’m playing abroad. Again, it’s down to a
				thing on my part, I reckon, as well.</p>
				
				<p>If the booking was something
				different, I’d look at it as a chance to push what I do to somewhere different.
				I wouldn’t turn it down. Next week I’m going to Ghana for the first time,
				that’s with a promoter out there, that’ll be interesting. Obviously, they’re
				going to be more familiar with what we’re playing, like amapiano. But we’re
				still going to bring our vibe and how we do it. </p>
				
				<p>For me, that’s closer to home
				than somewhere in Europe. It’s not the same as me going to Belgium or
				something.</p>
				
				&nbsp

				<p><b>NKC: </b>The reason I ask is because
				I don’t think people wrote about UK funky in the right way in the media at the
				time, so I’m trying to work out if people aren’t familiar with you because of
				that.</p>
				
				<p><b>Supa D:</b> With that, I think
				it’s because I wasn’t really producing back then, that’s what it is.</p>
				
				&nbsp

				<p><b>NKC: </b>You’ve got Mellowbone
				from South Africa on houSupa, are you collaborating with other South African
				artists while you’re producing amapiano and Afro house?</p>
				
				<p><b>Supa D: </b>There’s a couple
				up and coming South African artists we’re talking to. They’re talented, I’m
				here to help them in a way as well, in the same wave as the producers over
				here. Again, it’s a networking thing, being in certain places and letting
				people know who you are. That’s a thing on my side, where I need to do more.</p>
				
				&nbsp

				<p><b>NKC</b>: How has your label
				showcase night This is houSupa developed?</p>
				
				<p><b>Supa D: </b>It started in
				Dalston, then we went Shoreditch, from there we took it to Pop Brixton, from
				June 2022.</p>
				
				<p>All the producers that are on the
				label, they’ll come and do their DJ sets and everyone’s got their new tunes
				they’ve produced. On the whole it’s based on productions from the camp, new and
				old. It’s about our sound and what we’re bringing.</p>
				
				<p>We always get someone passing
				through as well – at the last one Ms Dynamite passed through, she jumped on the
				mic, it was good.</p>
				
				<p>My main thing is pushing the
				scene, pushing what we do, getting it out to the masses.</p>
