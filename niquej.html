			<p>Nique J has followed house music
				for some time, through the dance battles of her teenage years to the UK funky coach
				trips of her university days, but she’s a relatively fresh face behind the
				decks in London. She started DJing in 2019, not too long before the UK’s first
				lockdown, and began by sharing music through social media livestreams as a way
				to keep herself and her friends’ spirits high. </p>
				
				<p>This passion for music as a form
				of communal connection runs through nearly everything she’s involved in. Coming
				into DJing with a background as a professional dancer, Nique J is attentive to
				the way emotions and narrative can be built up and transferred through rhythm
				and movement. She truly values music’s expressive, therapeutic and healing
				qualities and, in the way that she talks about her journey so far, you can
				sense the earnest enthusiasm and excitement at building new friendships with
				DJs, producers and dancers around these shared experiences.</p>
				
				<p>You can also hear Nique J’s
				optimism and upbeat sensibility coming through in her recorded mixes. She makes
				even the darkest, toughest amapiano and UK funky anthems sound surprisingly
				joyous, through the sudden introduction of a dancehall or bhangra acapella, by chopping
				into an amapiano flip of a ‘00s house classic, or leaving a ‘90s RnB edit lingering
				on over the next track’s heavy bassline. “It’s Nique J!!!” her 7-year-old goddaughters’s
				voice sporadically booms over the blends.</p>

				<p><b>NKC: </b>How did you get
				started out with DJing?</p>
				
				<p><b>Nique J:</b> My journey with
				DJing started when my dad organised a party holiday to Malta back in 2019. After
				experiencing the DJs there I said, ‘oh, I want to do that!’ When I came back, I
				spoke to a few friends who DJ and asked what I needed to buy and what software
				to use. And then I used to spend my evenings at home after work learning. </p>
				
				<p>Before being a DJ, I was a
				professional dancer. I started doing battles in the UK and abroad, and I just
				wanted to experience what it was like to step over to the other side.</p>
				
				<p>When I started doing livestreams
				on social media I was mainly playing salsa music and Latin sounds, because
				that’s what my friends missed during lockdown. Then it changed and I started
				doing livestreams playing grime, RnB, and started to throw in house. I want to
				shout out ZJ Sneaks, Play, Rocaball, Skills, RJ, Melo-D, Jerome Kidman and
				Dazzle UK for our Pirate Studio sessions too, which helped me get more
				confident on the decks.</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<p><b>NKC: </b>Is dancing a full-time
				job for you? How does that tie in with DJing and playing house music?</p>
				
				<p><b>Nique J:</b> My full time job
				is in education – teaching and pastoral care – and then I also have dancing and
				DJing as well. But yeah, my love for music started with dance.</p>
				
				<p>I gravitated to house because
				that and hip hop were my favourite genres to battle with. I loved the different
				sounds from being in a house battle, whether it was the first stage when you’re
				trying to get past the judges or the rounds when you’re competing against
				somebody. </p>
				
				<p>When the style of house dance
				became popular in dancing classes and battles, I was 16 or 17. I fell in love
				with it straightaway, and from then I started to research the music. If we were
				in classes I’d ask ‘what song’s that?’ This is in the days of CDs, so people
				would have to make you a CD to share the music with you!</p>
				
				<p>The freedom of expression that
				you have within dance has heavily influenced my DJing. When I connect with the
				music as a dancer, I ask myself – ‘what story am I trying to tell with my
				movement?’ Or, ‘how am I trying to make you understand the music?’ That’s
				definitely translated over into DJing, because now when I’m on the decks I ask
				those same questions. I want the people listening to come on this musical
				journey that I’m on as well.</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<img class="home-image" alt="Nique J" src="images/niquej2.jpeg">

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<p><b>NKC: </b>How did amapiano and Afro
				house influence your DJing?</p>
				
				<p><b>Nique J:</b> In 2019, I went
				to an event before we went into lockdown and the track that I heard was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQJSqX0yIOE" target="blank">Prince
				Kaybee ft Lady Zemarr – ‘Charlotte.’</a> I remember hearing it and I was like, ‘what
				is <i>this</i>?’ The DJ on the decks at the time was Simone Martinez and I
				remember talking to her and her saying, ‘yeah, there’s this sound called
				amapiano.’ I went away and researched it and I just fell in love with it.</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<p><b>NKC: </b>Why do people call
				you the ‘queen of unshazambles’?</p>
				
				<p><b>Nique J:</b> I remember
				watching a few of Sir Salem’s livestreams and sitting there with my phone in my
				hand and I’m like, ‘Shazam can’t find this song, what’s this?' So then I
				started to ask in the comments, with the hashtag ‘#unshazamables’. </p>
				
				<p>Then I connected with Salem and
				Ronnie Loko, and we used to go to Pirate Studios together. I was always trying
				to find new sounds. I like the tracks that everybody listens to, but I always like
				to try and find things that are different, to try and find what makes me move.
				There would be times when we were in the studio when he’d be like, ‘what’s
				this, Shazam can’t find it?’ And I was like, ‘yeah, unshazamable!’ It was a
				little thing that we had. </p>
				
				<p>Now when I play, they will always
				say, ‘we’ve got the queen of unshazamables stepping up,’ because I will always
				throw in something you can’t find. Whether it’s a song that Shazam can’t find
				or an edit that I’ve put together.</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<p><b>NKC: </b>What are your sources
				for unshazamables and tracks people haven’t heard before?</p>
				
				<p><b>Nique J:</b> There are a few
				things I’ve put together myself, just a mixture of acapellas with some amapiano
				sounds. Bandcamp is really good for new sounds as well. I really do love
				Bandcamp, especially for discovering artists that produce amapiano that I’ve
				never heard of before. Sometimes I use SoundCloud, especially when they make
				suggestions based on things you listen to.</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<p><b>NKC:</b> Why do you like doing
				livestreams?</p>
				
				<p><b>Nique J:</b> For me, it’s the connection
				with other people. During the lockdown period, it was a tough time for everyone
				– you can’t leave your house, you can’t see anybody. There’s a phrase that
				people say: music is a healer, music is therapy. And I think if it wasn’t for
				music, or being connected, I don’t know how I would have gotten through that
				period. </p>
				
				<p>What the livestreams also did is
				enabled you to connect with people that you’d never met before. The beauty of
				it is that now events have opened back up and we’re back outside again, doing
				things, you’re now able to meet these people in the flesh and you’ve made
				totally new friendships. </p>
				
				<p>People remember how you made them
				feel during the livestreams. So when you continue to do them, now that we’re
				out of that lockdown period, they want to share the livestream and send the
				link around. It’s the beauty of connection.</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<p><b>NKC: </b>What are some of your
				favourite gigs you’ve played so far?</p>
				
				<p><b>Nique J:</b> I’ve played at
				<a href ="https://www.instagram.com/looneychoonz/" target="blank">Looney Choonz</a> twice, and I really enjoyed those. I first experienced Looney
				Choonz through their livestreams, then attending an event, and then becoming
				friends with the team. Then they gave me that opportunity – like ‘yeah, come on
				and play.’ I was thinking ‘Who, little old me?!’</p>
				
				<p>The growth of Looney Choonz, the
				support, and just how everybody plays – I enjoy it. Whether I’m playing or
				whether I’m on the dancefloor, it’s the energy of the events. Every time they
				do one it’s always a different feeling that you leave with, a different high
				that you’re on.</p>
				
				<p>I’m part of another collective
				called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/themidnighttrainsesh/" target="blank">the Midnight Train,</a> we’re actually all dancers as well. It’s so funny
				how we’ve all gravitated together with DJing too, and now we put on regular
				events. We’re multi-genre, so we play all sounds. The energy from that is out
				of this world, because you get the dance community that come, then you also get
				people passing through the Hackney area that are like, ‘oh, what’s happening
				here?’ And also word of mouth. Another is Werk The Floor London – Get Up To Get
				Down Dance Battle.</p>
				
				<p>I also really enjoyed playing <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dreamnightsldn/" target="blank">Dream
				Nights,</a> with J Fam and Chloe. I warmed up when they had TxC over from South
				Africa. And I love playing at Flipper's Roller Boogie Palace too!</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<p><b>NKC: </b>How does UK funky fit
				into your influences and DJing?</p>
				
				<p><b>Nique J:</b> I went to university
				in Canterbury, so not too far from London. Back then, we would go to UK funky
				coach raves in Birmingham and Hertfordshire. There was just something about the
				sounds, and obviously you had the MCs as well, so funky definitely spurred me
				on. </p>
				
				<p>What’s good is that you hear
				those same songs now and they still hit the same way. Everybody is still doing
				the dances, because there were specific dances for some of those tracks. Funky
				is a big part of my journey, whether that’s dancing to it or DJing it. It’s a
				sound I will never get tired of.</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<p><b>NKC:</b> Do you have any go-to
				artists for amapiano and Afro house sounds?</p>
				
				<p><b>Nique J</b>: I like MDU, Kelvin
				Momo, Kabza de Small, Felo le Tee, Mellow and Sleazy, Demnatuda, Busta 929… Anything
				that Mad One produces, I love it, and anything that Razzlerman and LR Groove
				produce too. Also Growzie, Marcus Damon, Antony Ranz, Hyde Original, Eastwood,
				Maestro, Scotti Dee, Supa D, Taffa… Polo as well, can’t forget Polo!</p>
				
				<p>With Mad One, I remember playing
				one of his songs, and only realising recently – ‘you’re the producer!’ I used
				to listen to his music in my younger days. That’s the beauty of the journey so
				far, meeting the people behind these sounds, not knowing that years down the
				line our paths would cross.</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<p><b>NKC: </b>Why do you think
				there are so many new faces on the UK Afro house and amapiano scenes?</p>
				
				<p><b>Nique J:</b> I think that a lot of the new faces in the scene now have always been
				there, but they just needed something to encourage them to get more involved.</p>
				
				<p>Speaking for myself, my hours
				were crazy at the job that I was in before. Sometimes I was doing 10, 11, 12
				hour shifts. I was coming home and probably had 30 minutes on the DJ controller
				until I was falling asleep. The lockdown period gave me the time to understand
				the theory side of music, as well as the practical side of making your mixes
				harmonically, and understanding the different sounds.</p>
				
				<p>If lockdown hadn’t given me that
				pause button, I don’t know where I would be now with music and DJing. Time was
				definitely on my side for that. </p>
				
				<p>I said this to Sir Salem as well
				– if we never had that massive pause in life, I would have never heard about
				Looney Choonz… because back then I was all about dance shows, battling, maybe
				going out to the odd night here and there, but not to the places where I would
				have heard the sounds I hear now. </p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<img class="home-image" alt="Nique J" src="images/niquej3.jpeg">
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<p><b>NKC: </b>What do you call the
				sound and scene you’re involved in, have you heard it called any genre names
				like ‘UK amapiano’ or ‘UK ama?’</p>
				
				<p><b>Nique J:</b> I’ve not heard it
				given a specific name, personally. I would just hear it for what it is, whether
				that’s Afro house or amapiano. I think what makes our sound distinct to us in
				London is the bounce that we have, from the funky house sound. That’s what
				makes it different, if I had to differentiate it, but I’ve never heard it
				called anything like ‘UK ama.’</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<p><b>NKC:</b> Do you produce music
				as well?</p>
				
				<p><b>Nique J:</b> I want to learn
				how to produce! My younger brother is a music producer, so he’s been taking his
				time out, bless him, to show me stuff. With me, I’m a very visual learner, but
				I also like to write things down, so I’ve got my little notebook. He uses FL
				Studio and he also uses Logic Pro, so I’ve got both on my Mac. For me it’s just
				learning to understand the beginning part, like drum patterns. A lot of people
				say to me, ‘once you’ve got your drum pattern, you’re good to go.’ And I’m
				like, ‘okay, but how do you do that?!’ But yeah, it’s definitely on my list of
				things that I would love to do in 2023. </p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<p><b>NKC:</b> Is there anything
				that you think would improve the scene you’re in?</p>
				
				<p><b>Nique J:</b> No, at the minute,
				everything is going good in terms of networking with everybody and going to
				events – whether I’m supporting events or playing at them. </p>
				
				<p>I would say that I want to see it
				keep flourishing and keep growing. Especially for the younger generation coming
				up as well. There are a lot of 11 and 12 year olds that are starting to pick up
				DJing. My goddaughter, she’s seven, I’ve started teaching her. </p>
				
				<p>To anybody that is coming up who
				is a lot younger – I want them to know that there’s so much space, so much
				love, and there are so many people who are around to support and help you. Just
				come and enjoy the journey.</p>
