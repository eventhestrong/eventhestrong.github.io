			<i>This interview forms part of <a href="https://mixmag.net/feature/london-afro-house-underground-movement-evolving-south-africa-amapiano-afro-tech-funky-interview" target="blank">'Crossover and collectivity: why London’s house underground is evolving'.</a> It has been edited for clarity.</i><p>

				<p>The second time I met Marcus
				Damon was at houSupa’s event Afrotized. I was talking to another DJ, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/djglamzino/" target="blank">Glamzino</a>, and
				had asked him who his favourite London producers were. Glamzino pointed over at
				Marcus. “This guy,” he said, “is the future.”</p>
				
				<p>In recent years Marcus Damon has
				been behind some of the most anthemic, instantly-recogniseable releases in the
				UK’s underground amapiano and Afro-influenced house music scenes, consistently
				dropping tracks on houSupa, Club Djembe and his own imprint Damonised Music. </p>
				
				<p>He says things could have gone
				differently: after grinding it out in music for just shy of 15 years and
				releasing an album that didn’t land how he’d hoped, he was on the verge of
				taking a break from producing, right before two of his tracks broke into underground
				radio rotation in 2019. Really though, it’s hard to imagine someone as
				committed as Marcus putting things on hold. From poking around the back of
				sound systems, to spending his teenage weekends in pirate radio studios, to
				carefully observing the mixing styles of his favourite DJs – Marcus has studied
				his craft. He’s also highly prolific, releasing several EP projects a year on
				top of a steady stream of singles, collaborating with singers like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/meising13_/" target="blank">Mei-Sing</a> and
				<a href="https://www.instagram.com/lushkells/" target="blank">LushKells</a> and producers like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/anthony_ranz/" target="blank">Anthony Ranz</a> and Apple.</p>
				
				<p>What stands out about Marcus’
				tracks is their hybridity and melodic edge. He’s got a talent for writing hooks
				that will stick in your head for weeks after hearing them out in the club, melding
				amapiano with soulful and tech house influences to create music that’s hard to
				categorise, but feels strongly rooted in the sonic history of his surroundings:
				London and soundsystem culture.</p>
				
				<p>Having recently launched his
				imprint Damonised as an event series in London, Marcus is ambitious for the
				future, hoping to develop the brand for international audiences. The first event
				looked promising, with a solid following turning out to support his new
				endeavour. All the while, Marcus remembers the people who helped him get
				started – continuing to shout out his early days mentors and influences each
				time he reaches a new milestone.</p>

				<p><b>NKC: </b>What’s your musical
				background?</p>
				
				<p><b>Marcus Damon:</b> Informally,
				my mum used to be a DJ. When I went to christenings and stuff like that and
				they used to have these big sound systems with the decks – I always thought,
				how did the music come out of the speakers? How are the vinyls creating this
				kind of frequency?</p>
				
				<p>I was so wowed by it. From that
				point on I’ve always had this obsession about how things are plugged in, and
				the engineering side of things – the sound quality.</p>
				
				<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
				
				<p><b>NKC: </b>That’s an interesting
				angle for someone so young, to concentrate on how the speakers were wired up,
				and how the sounds were being produced. It must have been like magic.</p>
				
				<p><b>Marcus Damon: </b>I was about
				six or seven when I was going to these things. You can’t really ask the adults
				questions because they don’t take you seriously at that age. Now it’s quite
				different, you can just go on YouTube if you don’t want to ask no one.</p>
				
				<p>From that point, I was trying to
				get into DJing. My mum bought my first decks when I was ten years old. She
				bought the ‘Home DJ Mix Kit’ from Argos. Just a standard CD player, two CDs and
				a mixer in the middle, and it comes with two speakers. She bought me a Pure
				Garage CD, and I was mixing tunes like ‘Sincere’ and music by Sunship. </p>
				
				<p>That’s where it all started, and
				from there I just kept building. I went to vinyl – I didn’t go forward, I went
				back. I wanted to go back to vinyl to get the full DJ effect. DJing started
				from vinyl, so I needed to go back to see how they do it, and master that
				skill.</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<p><b>NKC: </b>In your artist bio,
				you mention DJing hip hop, RnB, soul, jazz, house and garage when you started
				out. How does that fit in with what you’re doing now?</p>
				
				<p><b>Marcus Damon:</b> Basically, I
				just wanted to play what I liked. That’s usually the first reason why people
				start DJing, they want to play music that they like to the people. When I
				started, I was heavily into dancehall and reggae, so I was collecting reggae
				music – I’m talking CDs, like going to CD Bar in Stratford and buying up CDs
				every week.</p>
				
				<p>I find it easier to create house
				over a lot of other genres. But now I’ve advanced as a producer, I can make a
				lot of things. Just the other day I made a dancehall track. I’m trying to be a
				producer and not be attached to one genre… But that’s a new level thing, that’s
				like a DJ Khaled thing!</p>
				
				<p>With amapiano stuff now, creating
				melodies is my thing over the drums and bass. So if you listen to a lot of my
				amapiano tracks, they’re very melodic.</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<p><b>NKC:</b> You mentioned there
				were sound systems at christenings, were you around a lot of sound systems at
				events growing up?</p>
				
				<p><b>Marcus Damon:</b> I think
				about 80% of Black people, they’ve been around sound systems, it’s like music
				drives them. That’s just my opinion. So basically yeah, there’s been a lot of
				sound systems, a lot of music going on, music every day. I’ve grown up around
				people who make speakers. It’s just always been in my life.</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<img class="home-image" alt="Marcus Damon" src="images/marcus2.JPG">
			
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<p><b>NKC: </b>Were you into funky
				house, UK funky, and soulful house when that was popular?</p>
				
				<p><b>Marcus Damon:</b> I was on
				pirate radio – Heat FM – when UK funky was popular. We’re talking about 2009/10
				and I was 15/16 years old. I’m in the studio playing all these CDs with UK
				funky and the skank tracks, and people were calling the studio phone and asking
				me, ‘where’s the place to be?’ </p>
				
				<p>I was like, ‘I’m not even old
				enough to get in the rave!’</p>
				
				<p>So when UK funky was big, I was
				playing all the tunes, all the top tens, but I can’t really say anything about
				playing in the clubs, because I was a bit too young to go.</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<p><b>NKC: </b>How long have you
				been producing music for, tell me about how you got started out?</p>
				
				<p><b>Marcus Damon</b>: I’ve been
				producing from secondary school. I got Cubase and other software and just
				learnt the basics back in 2008. I’m not really the type of person that likes to
				read on stuff – I know you should – but I like to find these things out.</p>
				
				<p>It’s been trial and error this
				whole time while I’ve been getting an understanding of production – learning
				how to put beats together, how to create different patterns, different sounds,
				what sounds mix together, what plugins are, mastering, the whole thing.</p>
				
				<p>Then when I went to university I
				started doing recordings. I was helping my friend out at Newbury College,
				learning how to work behind the desk.</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<p><b>NKC: </b>A lot of your music
				is focused on melody, harmony, chord progressions – do you play any instruments
				or have you just picked it up from producing?</p>
				
				<p><b>Marcus Damon: </b>My college
				teacher – <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sterlingreigns/" target="blank">Sterling Reigns</a> – he’s a sick guy, the top man of his
				game. He always said: learn basic chords, and then from that you can map things
				around them.</p>
				
				<p>Sterling Reigns always built in
				my head that it’s about the fundamentals of everything. Once you’ve got the
				chords, you’re able to make anything. A lot of people like to focus on drums
				because it starts hitting quick. But if you learn basic chords, you’re able to
				make melodies.</p>
				
				<p>With amapiano, you usually get
				the feel from the shakers, bongo hits, conga hits, and maybe the snare, open
				hihats. That’ll be the first to go into the track, that will get you started on
				the feel. Then we add the melody – pads, soft chords, Rhodes, flutes maybe, and
				add a high lead – that’s how I start.</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<p><b>NKC: </b>Talking about melody,
				some of your tracks have got this driving, minimal feel that I associate with
				deep tech house – ‘Ride Out’ for example.</p>
				
				<p><b>Marcus Damon</b>: With a tune
				like ‘Ride Out’, which is on Housupa, that’s very techy. That’s because
				amapiano was new to a lot of people, so I still needed to keep the feel of what
				they know, to push them into the changeover. So I made a hybrid, with that tech
				house lead, but ama drums and ama bass.</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<img class="home-image" alt="Marcus Damon" src="images/marcus3.jpg">

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<p><b>NKC: </b>The log drum is
				actually a similar sound to the bass used in some deep tech tracks.</p>
				
				<p><b>Marcus Damon:</b>I think
				people get it wrong with how amapiano is perceived sometimes. The log drum
				isn’t actually always a bassline. It’s part of the drums, it’s just got a bass
				sound to it. Then the sub plays as the bass.</p>
				
				<p>When people are making ‘UK ama’,
				they use the log drum in a different way, it’s not a bassline. They’re using it
				for rolls and it sounds like UK funky. Everyone’s got their own perceptions
				with making music, it’s about creativity.</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<p><b>NKC: </b>You’ve released a lot
				of music over the past couple of years, is there something that really sparked
				you off since around 2019?</p>
				
				<p><b>Marcus Damon: </b><a href="https://soundcloud.com/marcus_damon/antony-ranz-x-marcus-damon-pssy-fairy-uncut-remix" target="blank">‘Pussy Fairy’</a>
				definitely sparked off a lot of things. Again, that’s more tech house, it’s
				just that I made a bass-melody thing. It’s kind of a hybrid. And then after
				that track, the killer one is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kkJBLFVndA" target="blank">‘Momentum’.</a> That’s the one that sparked everyone,
				because of the legendary sample behind it… It definitely done the crossover.</p>
				
				<p>Before ‘Momentum’ and ‘Pussy
				Fairy’, I made an album called <i>Paradise House</i>. That one has about 15
				tracks or something, and it didn’t really do so well. I was going to hang it
				up, I felt like I didn’t want to produce no more, it had taken up a lot of my
				time and I still wasn’t getting nowhere. And then when I made ‘Pussy Fairy’ and
				everyone was loving it, and it was getting played on radio and everything, I
				was like – wow! It’s about time as well!</p>
				
				<p>That definitely drove me after
				that. I was making loads of music, changing the way I mix down and upgrading
				how I assemble productions.</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<p><b>NKC: </b>Without giving away
				the secret sauce, are there any specific sounds, VSTs, or techniques that you
				usually draw for when you’re producing?</p>
				
				<p><b>Marcus Damon: </b>You can give
				all the tools to somebody, it’s how they want to use them. But there is some
				sauce I’m going to keep!</p>
				
				<p>I use Massive a lot. I like a lot
				of the sounds on there and I’ve got a lot of packs.</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<p><b>NKC: </b>You have a lot of
				releases featuring other artists and singers, have you always worked
				collaboratively?</p>
				
				<p><b>Marcus Damon:</b> I’ve always
				believed that having a vocal on a track completes it, because words stay in
				people’s heads. It’s just another instrument really. So I’ve always wanted singers
				on my songs. I like mixing their vocals and dealing with different
				personalities through the mic.</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<p><b>NKC: </b>Do you usually work
				in studio sessions or by sending projects and files back and forth?</p>
				
				<p><b>Marcus Damon:</b> LushKells
				said to me recently, ‘I like the way you direct the session’. I don’t just tell
				people to come and sing. Firstly, that’s boring for me. Secondly, if you get a
				note wrong, I’m not going to sit there and let you do wrong, I’m going to make
				sure it’s right. I’ll sing with you and we can get the track finished together.
				I have a relationship with my singers where we can do it together, that’s the
				slogan.</p>
				
				<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
				
				<p><b>NKC: </b>How do you work with
				other producers?</p>
				
				<p><b>Marcus Damon: </b>Recently
				I’ve been sending stems, because I’m working with people that live in South
				Africa now. But usually I work with people in the studio together. People have
				got their percentages, at the end of the day. You want 50 percent, you’ve got
				to do 50 percent of the work, that’s how I feel. We’ve got to come to an
				agreement that ‘you’re doing this bit, I’m doing that bit’. I prefer working in
				person because we can make the edits there and then.</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<p><b>NKC: </b>How do you approach
				your DJ sets?</p>
				
				<p><b>Marcus Damon: </b>I take a lot
				of people’s advice, I do a lot of observations, watching what people who are
				playing to bigger crowds are doing.</p>
				
				<p>You’ve got to make time for these
				things, it doesn’t happen overnight. It takes time and discipline. In life, you
				can do whatever you want. I know some people’s circumstances probably don’t give
				them time, but you have to try.</p>
				
				<p>Sterling Reigns, he’s the one who
				made me into the kind of person that I am with DJing. He’s got a studio and I
				was always there. I was on the decks at music college teaching the younger
				generation who were doing cyphers and hip hop.</p>
				
				<p>With DJ sets, I pick music based
				on how I feel it blends together. I don’t put a playlist together, I just go
				with whatever I feel at the time. I just pick, mix and play. That’s how I deal
				with it. </p>
				
				<p>I also have a structure while
				DJing – it’s always vocal-instrumental-vocal-instrumental. You can’t play two
				vocal tracks at the same time unless the vocals are broken, otherwise you’ll
				start clashing. You can put two instrumentals together, that’s fine. But to
				keep the crowd engaged – people like to sing when they’re going out, when
				they’re drunk – I don’t play instrumentals for the whole set.</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<p><b>NKC: </b>I’ve seen you get
				quite technical with your DJing, you’re active with FX and delay. Is that live
				performance aspect of DJing important to you, when you’re not just playing the
				tracks but doing something new with them?</p>
				
				<p><b>Marcus Damon</b>: From Sterling
				Reigns, we go to Anthony Ranz. Now, we all know Anthony Ranz does what he does.
				I’ve always liked the way he plays house. So I’m observing his DJing and I’m
				kind of doing something similar. It’s not the same – he’s much more
				experienced, he’s been DJing longer. But I’ve learnt from Ranz how to get my
				effects levels up and how to work with timings and using other effects.</p>
				
				<p>I call it sound designing, that’s
				my thing. I use 1/16ths and 1/8ths delays a lot – it’s crazy to explain, I
				can’t lie to you. You have to be there and really listen. Sometimes I wow
				myself, I go back to my mixes and I’m hearing how the effects are used and it’s
				crazy.</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<p><b>NKC:</b> You’ve shared some
				debates via your social media about the tempo people play amapiano at in
				London, could you talk about that?</p>
				
				<p><b>Marcus Damon</b>: Someone came
				up to us and said we were playing the music too fast. But 112-114bpm – that’s
				what amapiano sounds like when you’re at home. </p>
				
				<p>A lot of people have come out to
				party, we’ve come out to rave it up. So I play it at 117bpm. People can still
				move – it’s not too fast, it’s not too slow. I can still hear the attributes of
				the music. </p>
				
				<p>So as long as it’s not crazy
				fast… I can’t lie to you, 124-125bpm is too fast for ama. Each to their own
				though, if you can get people moving then that’s cool. I’m not judging, I’m just
				saying what I’m doing. If you play at 124, then maybe you feel the music
				differently.</p>
				
				<p>I think people need to understand
				what they’re playing – remember, this is new to a lot of people. People can get
				away with a lot of funky sounds with this ama ting, because it’s new. They can
				play it their way, and the people that come to their raves, if they already got
				a name for the sound they’re not going to know any better. All they know is
				that, ‘oh, this sounds like what I used to listen to’, i.e. UK funky.</p>
				
				<p>It’s about understanding the
				music. Now, again, someone will probably say that what I’m saying don’t make
				sense, because I don’t play it at the original speed anyway. But when it’s too
				fast, it’s a different category of music, it’s not the same.</p>
				
				<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
				
				<p><b>NKC: </b>You launched your
				event series Damonised recently. What’s the idea behind it and what have you
				got planned for the future?</p>
				
				<p><b>Marcus Damon: </b>The
				Damonised event is about my productions and my experience for the ravers, the
				people that want to listen to what I’m doing. It’s a personal touch – because I
				create the music, the productions, it gives people a chance to meet me as a
				person. Music is based on emotions and as I’m playing it they can feel the
				music through me.</p>
				
				<p>The first Damonised event was
				February 17<sup>th</sup>. It went well. Most of the people that were there,
				they’re people who have been listening to my music for the past few years, or
				followed my journey completely. </p>
				
				<p>I’ll be taking Damonised to the
				next level in the next two to three years. I’m hoping to build the brand to
				where I’m doing stages at festivals. I want to get into the fashion industry
				with Damonised as well. It’s another avenue for the brand. </p>
				
				<p>The idea is to make it a global
				thing and make it suitable for everyone. I’m not on small spaces, I want to go
				worldwide with this. I want to take Damonised overseas. I’m going to try and
				get some links to different clubs and venues over the world – Ibiza, Ayia Napa,
				Zante, even places like Sweden. It’s going to be a great adventure.</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<img class="home-image" alt="Marcus Damon" src="images/marcus4.png">

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<p><b>NKC: </b>Would you call the
				scene you’re part of amapiano or Afro house, or something else?</p>
				
				<p><b>Marcus Damon</b>:  I feel
				like, in 2020, producers were still learning – I’m talking about everyone – about
				this amapiano sound. So there were people making crossovers. They were calling
				it amapiano, but it’s actually house or soulful house. At present, everyone has
				reached a level where they know what they’re doing. They know what sounds to
				use, how to use them, how to make the swing of the tracks.</p>
				
				<p>Afro house is what Black Koffee
				plays. That’s how I look at it. He plays Afro tech, that kind of tribal sound. I
				would not class my music as Afro house. Even <a href="https://www.beatport.com/track/lockdown-feat-antony-ranz/16930385" target="blank">‘Lockdown’</a> is ama, or it’s
				ama-influenced. We’ve got to say that, we’ve got to tread carefully on that as
				well, because people will comment and say, ‘well this ain’t what people make in
				SA’. So it’s amapiano-influenced.</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<p><b>NKC:</b> Is there anything you
				think would make the Afro house and amapiano scenes better, are there any
				negatives?</p>
				
				<p><b>Marcus Damon:</b> There needs
				to be more diversity in crowds. Bluntly speaking, white people need to come
				to our raves as well, and enjoy the vibes the same way. </p>
				
				<p>When you hear dancehall, your
				first thought is not that there won’t be many white people there at the party. More
				diversity in the raves is what makes the raves grow. If you’re locked into a
				certain crowd, you’re always going to get the same people. To grow, you need
				everyone – you need <i>everyone</i>.</p>
